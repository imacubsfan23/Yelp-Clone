* Front End: React.js, Bootstrap
* Back End: Express.js

## Setup

* Create an account with yelp [here](https://www.yelp.com/signup)
* [Follow the instructions here to get started with the Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)
* Clone this repository
* In your terminal, cd into the "Yelp-Clone" Repository
* run `npm install`
* run `export YELP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` where `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` is your API Key

## Original Task

Create a two-page application using the Yelp Fusion API.

1. On the first page, you should be able to search for businesses in Naperville, IL.
2. When you select a result, it should take you to a second page where you can see details about the business.

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to show us your ability to code. We will be looking at how you handle making requests to an API, as well as how you handle the JSON responses. We will also be looking for basic understanding of React components, and for proficiency in javascript (usage of ES6 features is encouraged).

## Yelp Fusion API

Documentation on API usage can be found [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3). For this application, I used the `Search API` and the `Business API`.

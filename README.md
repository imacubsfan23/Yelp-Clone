A simple clone of Yelp using the Yelp Fusion API

* Front End: React.js, Bootstrap
* Back End: Express.js, Heroku

## Original Task

Create a two-page application using the Yelp Fusion API.

1. On the first page, you should be able to search for businesses in Naperville, IL.
2. When you select a result, it should take you to a second page where you can see details about the business.

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to learn more about React, Express, and how to use an API with JavaScript.
I also learned how to build a static site with React, as well as how to host an Express/React app on Heroku

## Yelp Fusion API

Documentation on API usage can be found [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3). For this application, I used the `Search API` and the `Business API`.
